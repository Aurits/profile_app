## Overview

In this project, you'll create a personal profile page featuring:

- A profile picture and your name.
- A bio section where you can describe yourself.
- A skills table highlighting your core competencies.
- A contact section with email and social links.
- A project list showcasing your recent projects.
- A button to update profile details interactively using JavaScript.

By following this guide, you will:
- Learn how to build a simple yet effective web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Understand how to use GitHub for version control and GitHub Pages to host your site.

---

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following tools installed on your computer:

- **Git** ‚Äì For version control and pushing code to GitHub.
- **A Code Editor** ‚Äì Such as Visual Studio Code for editing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Web Browser** ‚Äì Chrome, Firefox, or any modern browser for previewing your work.

## Tech Stack & Tools

The technologies used in this project are simple yet foundational for any web development project:

### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML is the backbone of web pages, used to structure content like text, images, and links. In this project, you‚Äôll use HTML to build the structure of your profile page.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style the HTML elements and make the page visually appealing. You‚Äôll use CSS to make your page look clean, modern, and minimalist.

### JavaScript
JavaScript adds interactivity to your web pages. In this project, you'll use JS to make your profile page dynamic by allowing users to update their information.

### GitHub & GitHub Pages
GitHub is a version control platform, and GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from your repository.

## How to Build the Profile Page

### 1. Setting Up Your Project

- **Fork this Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of this repository on GitHub.
- **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minimalist-profile.git
cd minimalist-profile
```

- **Open in Code Editor**: Open the project in your favorite code editor (e.g., VS Code).

---

### 2. Creating the HTML Structure

In the `index.html` file, you'll build the skeleton of the profile page using basic HTML tags like `<div>`, `<img>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, etc.

Make sure your HTML file is clean and semantic, meaning you should use elements that accurately represent the content, like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`.

#### Key sections to include:
- **Profile Header**: A section for the profile picture and your name.
- **Bio**: A brief description about yourself.
- **Skills Table**: A neat table listing your core skills.
- **Contact Info**: A simple list with your contact information and links.
- **Projects List**: Display a few projects you‚Äôve worked on.

Here's a simple example:

```html
<div class="profile-header">
    <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Your Photo">
    <h1>Your Name</h1>
</div>
<p>Brief bio about yourself...</p>
```

---

### 3. Styling with CSS

Open the `style.css` file and start by styling the profile page to look clean and professional. 

#### Use a minimalist approach:
- Choose 1 or 2 colors for the page.
- Apply modern fonts (we used Google Fonts in this example).
- Use flexbox for layout to ensure everything aligns well.

Sample CSS snippet:

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    color: #333;
}
.profile-header img {
    border-radius: 50%;
    width: 120px;
}
```

---

### 4. Adding Interactivity with JavaScript

Open `script.js` and add JavaScript functionality that allows users to update profile information dynamically using `prompt()`.

Sample JS code:

```javascript
function updateProfile() {
    const newName = prompt("Enter your new name:");
    document.querySelector('h1').textContent = newName;
}
document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', updateProfile);
```

---

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

Once you've built the project, follow these steps to publish your profile page on GitHub Pages:

1. **Commit and Push Your Changes**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of profile page"
git push origin main
```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Click on **Settings**.
   - Scroll down to **GitHub Pages** and under the source, select `main` branch and click Save.
   - Your profile page will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/minimalist-profile/`.

## Project Submission

After you've completed your profile page and published it on GitHub Pages, share your repository with others and submit the link to the live page. Encourage feedback and collaborate with peers to enhance your skills.
